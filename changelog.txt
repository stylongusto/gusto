IMPORTANT: If your linkage works on large number of records with large number
of columns or if you are enablind results desuplication (in either available 
form), you may need to increase the memory available for FRIL. Go to FAQ 
section of the webpage for instructions.

Fixed bug when using FRIL in Batch mode (Null pointer exception).


Version 2.1.4
Fix: Fixed bug in selection of location for results file

        (if deduplication is enabled)

Version 2.1.1
New feature: Dynamic analysis tables show tooltips with full string value

The only difference between versions 2.1 and 2.1.1 is that the latter
uses a new version of openscv library used to read CSV files.
